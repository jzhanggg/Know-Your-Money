This project aims to help me keep track of my spending on my BMO Debit Card and analyze how much I spend on different things. Therefore

# What it does
It reads the statement files (in .csv format) a user downloaded from the BMO online banking site, allowing them to categorize each of their transactions quickly, and store the classified data locally. The user can perform the following operations and analysis of the data: 

**1. Categorize new transaction data from statement files and save them locally**

**2. See spending overview: by category + income vs. expense**

**3. Extract and see the record for selected categories and date**

**4. Update monthly expense data**

**5. Generate a table comparing expenses in different categories across each monthly period**

**6. Generate a line graph comparing Covered Balance, Personal Balance, and Savings**
